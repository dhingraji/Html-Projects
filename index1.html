Ghaziabad:- Ghaziabad is a city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and a part of Delhi NCR.It is the administrative headquarters of Ghaziabad district and is the largest city in western Uttar Pradesh, with a population of 1,729,000.
Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation is divided into 5 zones - City Zone, Kavi Nagar Zone, Vijay Nagar Zone, Mohan Nagar Zone and Vasundhara Zone.
The Municipal Corporation comprises 100 wards.Well connected by roads and railways, it is a major rail junction for North India.
It is sometimes referred to as the "Saya of Uttar Pradesh" because it is close to New Delhi, on the main route into Uttar Pradesh.Recent construction works have led to the city being described by a City Mayors 
Foundation survey as the second fastest-growing in the world.Situated in the Upper Gangetic Plains, the city has two major divisions separated by the Hindon River, namely Trans-Hindon on the west and Cis-Hindon on the east.Ghaziabad, along with Meerut and Bulandshahr, remained one of the three Munsifis of the District, under the Meerut Civil Judgeship during most periods of the British Raj 
Ghaziabad was associated with the Indian independence movement from the Indian Rebellion of 1857.<br>
